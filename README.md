Things you may want to cover:
## What it does?
Users can create events and see other members registered to his events. Events take place at a specific time and location. Give a brief description of your party for your attendees to see what's about. You will need to log in to create an event and attend (only for future events).

* Ruby version
## How it works?
The Model is working on top of the following resources:

* System dependencies
- Ruby (version 2.6.5)
- Rails (version 5.2.4)

* Configuration
And the next dependencies:

* Database creation
- sqlite3
- puma
- sass-rails
- uglifier
- coffee-rails
- turbolinks
- jbuilder
- bootsnap

* Database initialization
## Usage
### Step 1: Clone and install dependencies
Clone the repo and run `bundle install` to get all the gems on your terminal.
### Step 2: Run database migration
From terminal type `rails db:migrate` to get your schema updated
### Step 3: Work on IRB
That's it on configuration. Now you can just open your terminal to start on `rails server` and open your browser

* How to run the test suite
### Step 4: View your app
Now you can navigate to `localhost:3000` on your browser to see your app working.
Feel free to create as many events as you want. The other users will attend and you will get informed of that on your dashboard.

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
