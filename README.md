Private Event
==============

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
Microverse pathwright project wich consist on a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups.

Things you may want to cover:
## What it does?
Users can create events and see other members registered to his events. Events take place at a specific time and location. Give a brief description of your party for your attendees to see what's about. You will need to log in to create an event and attend (only for future events).

## How it works?
The Model is working on top of the following resources:

- Ruby (version 2.6.5)
- Rails (version 5.2.4)


And the next dependencies:

* Database creation
- sqlite3
- puma
- sass-rails
- uglifier
- coffee-rails
- turbolinks
- jbuilder
- bootsnap

## Usage
### Step 1: Clone and install dependencies
Clone the repo and run `bundle install` to get all the gems on your terminal.
### Step 2: Run database migration
From terminal type `rails db:migrate` to get your schema updated
### Step 3: Work on IRB
That's it on configuration. Now you can just open your terminal to start on `rails server` and open your browser

### Step 4: View your app
Now you can navigate to `localhost:3000` on your browser to see your app working.
Feel free to create as many events as you want. The other users will attend and you will get informed of that on your dashboard.
